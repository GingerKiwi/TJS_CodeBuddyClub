## What is a Code Buddy Club?

- It's similar to a book club
- Participants code together using free courses to learn new topics and share what we learned.
- Meet on discord to share progress, and provide support and debugging
- Each course should take roughly 1 - 8 weeks to complete
- Participants are free to code independently, or to pair program.
- It's a really relaxed, supportive, and social atmosphere.
