## What is Code Buddy Club?

Code buddy club is like a book club but instead of books participants go through free tutorial and courses together.

## Who?  

### Who Will Be Running The Code Buddy Club?

- Sami Xie
- Liz McCready
- Marco Campos
- Room for one more co-volunteer :-)
### Who is Code Buddy Club For?

This first round of Code Buddy Club in 2024 is aimed at junior developers, and anyone that wants to learn with a supportive group.

Participants can join at the start of any tutorial/ course, or even part way in if they are able to catch up.
## When Will It Run?

Twice a week for one hour.
- Sundays at 11:00am
- Tuesdays 6:30-7:30pm 

Attendance is flexible.
## Where Will It Be?

On TJS discord. 
Set up a Code Buddy channel
- Why on discord? 
		1.  Great place to have streaming and screen sharing
		2. Because this is knowledge that we want to persist, and Slack eats messages.

## Why

- Sami and Liz have been code buddies since October. 
- It's been really fun, 
- Helpful to have someone to share and debug the same projects
- Helps with motivation / accountability- set goals for things to complete
- Would love to open this up to other devs in Toronto JS.

## How Has The Schedule Been Developed?

Sami and Liz have found that going all out they have been able to get though 1-2 hours of tutorial videos per week. However, not everyone will have that time, and a much more relaxed pace is more inclusive. So there's about 30 minutes of tutorial video per week.

All the courses are free courses. The majority are on Egghead.io because the quality is good. There are also some from YouTube, and Wes Bos's free courses. Due to the changes with React in 2023, specifically the depreciation of create react app (CRA) courses with react that are older than 6 months haven't been included.

We have tried to alternate between shorter courses and slightly longer ones to give people the chance to join Code Buddy Club at almost any month of the year.
